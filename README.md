# Glacial_Extent_Mapping

# Changes in Icelandic glacial extent measured from satellite images
## Scenario

As human contributions to global climate change becomes more prominent even in our daily lives, increased greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in major changes in the glaciated regions on the planet. Even minute chemical changes in the atmosphere can result in regional changes in both temperature and precipitation and are key factors in determining the mass balance in glaciers. While glacial advance and retreat cycles occur naturally, the present retreat rate of glaciers in Iceland is faster than can be explained by natural processes alone. 
The Hifsjokull glacier is the third largest glacier in Iceland and is located atop a dormant volcano. While geothermal heat flux derived from subglacial volcanos can result in non-negligible contributions to glacial retreat, geothermal heat flux beneath Hifsjokull glacier has little implications on increasing glacial retreat rates within the past 20 years (JÃ³hannesson, et. al, 2020). As such, the Hifsjokull icecap is an ideal glacier for the purposes of this project in reference to invesitgating the implications of climate change on glacial extent.


## Problem
Glacial extent is changing rapidly over time. Traditional field-based mapping methods generally produce accurate results, but are difficult to keep up-to-date.  

## Solution 
Using the k-means clustering classification algorithm, a rough estimate of glacial extent of Hifsjokull glacier in 2016 and 2020 2020 calculated and compared. Landsat 8 data from summer of 2016 and 2020 were used to create composite red-green-blue (RGB) images that were composited into RGB images and a 5-cluster k-means algorithm was executed to produce rudimentary classifications. It was determined that the Hifsjokull glacier has decreased in area by 34.5 km2, which a reasonable estimate based on previous studies of the region.
